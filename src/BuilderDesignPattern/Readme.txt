Used in stringBuilder

creational design pattern - creational design pattern helps in creation of an object

assumer there is class in which only some fields are mandatory and others are optional so there will be a huge constructor parameters
so use this when huge constructor parameters for this we can also break big constructor into multiple small constructors but there
will be many constructors

step by step object creation pattern

mediator state is called builder then we call build


disadvantage - code dulicacy as builder will have same fields as main class
