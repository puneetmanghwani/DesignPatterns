At every state different operations are allowed . So in every state of product only specific operations are allowed so it is state
design pattern

example - vending machine
TV - off state -> press on button
     on state -> change channel,change volume


State design pattern - we take state as a interface, declare all operations in it then all concrete classes state1, state2 they will
implement their function which they need for other there will be default behaviour by them
